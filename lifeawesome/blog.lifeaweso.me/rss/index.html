2015 is already here. We hope you had a great time. Actually we hope you had an awesome time. <br>
Why awesome? <br>
Because you're awesome. <br>
This is the main point of lifeaweso.me.</p>

<p>As promised, we're trying to keep you updated about our work in progress. There were some changes in the last weeks, technical and non-technical decisions, along with some other more boring stuff.</p>

<p>In order to let you have a taste of <a href="http://lifeaweso.me">lifeaweso.me</a> ASAP, we've decided to try and release a closed Alpha for all those who will be still subscribed to our newsletter at the time being. We're talking about February 2015 (and we'll do our best and try to respect that schedule). We will be releasing more details about it very soon so stay tuned. The closed Alpha will have huge limitations, and obviously there will be a lot of things not yet developed, not working properly and a lot of bugs. <br>
We'll need you and your feedback in order to release a more stable Beta version in the near future, so just have a little more patience and we'll send you all the details in one of the next emails.</p>

A month ago <strong><a href="http://lifeaweso.me/">lifeaweso.me</a></strong> was barely an idea. <br>
Today we are releasing our new website and our new blog (thanks to <strong><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a></strong>) into the wild.</p>

<p>It's pretty scary - and incredibly exciting. <a href="https://twitter.com/Trip314">Myself</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/_danielep_">Daniele</a> are working very hard and we're still at the beginning, but we planned so much more, and it's really complicated to write about all the crazy stuff we came up to without becoming boring. I tried to keep it <strong>simple</strong>, but if this post seems still too long, skip directly to our <em>tl;dr</em> section.</p>

<p>We're not releasing a lot of information about <strong>Life Awesome</strong> yet, but this blog has the purpose of keeping you updated about our progress in this incredible journey.</p>

<p>And here we are, creating this amazing opportunity to talk a little bit more about the purpose and the value of our idea. We'll be talking about technology and design further on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without purpose we would not exist.</p>

<h1 id="whatislifeawesome">What is Life Awesome?</h1>

<p>First of all, the answer is not <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)">42</a></strong>. <br>
This is more of a personal question, trust me. <br>
We have <strong>Facebook</strong>. And then we have <strong>LinkedIn</strong>. And again, we have online <strong>portfolio</strong> platforms, or private <strong>diaries</strong> apps, or even <strong>travel organizers</strong>. <br>
As a huge <strong>sport &amp; activity</strong> fan, I enjoy doing all kind of crazy stuff, like <strong>snowboarding</strong>, <strong>diving</strong>, <strong>parachuting</strong>, <strong>rafting</strong>. I use my <strong>GoPro</strong> a lot, and I've been through all those awesome experiences that shaped me the way I am. Yes, I have social networks to share these accomplishments with my friends, but it feels like everything I achieve, a new personal record, a new project (like Life Awesome) being born, fades away in this data pollution we have today. <br>
Facebook (and no, I don't have an account there), has this funny and entertaining <strong>timeline</strong> (which is our main refactoring project in <strong>Life Awesome</strong>) to click back and relive a <strong>memory</strong> (which is usually you getting drunk with your friends on Saturday night, not the achievement we're looking to push here). And because their timeline catalogues everything, it makes impossible for the real <em>you</em> to have the right space that deserves.</p>

<p>We believe people deserve a simple and efficient way of creating a personal lifetime achievements book. Whether you are an accomplished businessman or simply a hitchhiker wanting to keep and track all of your movements across the globe. We're building Life Awesome around all those people that have accomplished great things in their lives.</p>

<p>Because we believe <strong>people are awesome</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.</p>

<h1 id="preview">Preview</h1>

<p>And now, just for the sake of the curious ones, here is a glimpse of what is the general design of our timeline (as said it's just a glimpse, we still prefer to keep the best part for ourselves for now):</p>

<p><img src="http://lifeaweso.me/blog/preview.jpg" alt="lifeaweso.me design preview"></p>

<p>Stay tuned and you'll be able to see our progress.    </p>

<h1 id="subscribeandearlyaccess">Subscribe and early access</h1>

<p>We're thinking of giving a privileged <strong>early beta access</strong> to our <strong>newsletter subscribers</strong>, and are keen to receive feedbacks from all of you interested in what we're trying to <strong>achieve</strong>.</p>

<p>Subscribe to our newsletter through <a href="http://lifeaweso.me">lifeaweso.me</a> or follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/lifeaweso_me">Twitter</a> to receive the latest updates.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>Are you a sport &amp; activity person, an <strong>artist</strong>, a businessman? Do you <strong>travel</strong> a lot? Are you a part of a <strong>rock band</strong> (or maybe just a <strong>DJ</strong> performing in different <strong>clubs</strong> every weekend)? <br>
Life Awesome is tailored for <strong>people</strong> like you. <br>
Life Awesome will offer you a completely new approach to a social network. <br>
Life Awesome will give you the <strong>focus and simplicity</strong> stretched in a <strong>minimal timeline</strong> that will allow you to show others the <strong>real you</strong> and what are you capable of.</p>]]></description><link>http://blog.lifeaweso.me/introducing-life-awesome/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">10f65fd2-cafc-4833-b1c9-79497e28ee62</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[lifeaweso.me]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2014 12:53:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
